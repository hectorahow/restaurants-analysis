Very enjoyable with an amazing vinaigrette dressing. The steak was cooked perfectly and full of flavor. We loved the fact that the oysters were large and full of flavor. Stir fry shrimp had the perfect level of spice it doesn‚Äôt come too spicy but you can always add more. The restaurant was kind enough to send us a slice of cake for our anniversary as well. I also have nothing but good things to say about our waiter, Rick. Thanks for your suggestions and taking the time to explain pairings with us.',\n",
       " 'Food and service was great. Only issue is that it‚Äôs incredibly overpriced. $8 to add 1/2 an avocado to a salad. Also, they charge for substitutions, even if they are they same price. $2 substitution fee for green beans instead of asparagus. $2 fee for regular mashed potatoes instead of fried potato salad. This is on top of the $46 price for a filet.\\nIf you want to feel extremely nickel and dimed, this is the place to go.',\n",
