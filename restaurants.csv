French dip was spot on! Beer was great! I had a local ipa and my wife had a mixed drink.

It‚Äôs a place you must visit when in Houston!,Awesome selection of beer including many locals, which is exactly what I came for. Food is fine but unremarkable, but that‚Äôs not why you‚Äôre here. The plates recognizing all the people that drink too much beer were cool - I‚Äôd definitely have one if I lived nearby.,Good spot for a variety of beers. Outdoor seating is nice minus all the homeless people begging or sitting there.  Always great friendly bartenders though.,Great spot to come for a beer when you‚Äôre hanging or working downtown. Best spot for 100s of beers, actually. They even give you a plate with whatever you want to print on it if you drink 1-200 of their exotic beers from their extensive list."

The service is always top notch. The room service is actually tasty. The location is close to a ton of attractions. The shuttle they offer to get around was so much better than getting an Uber. This is one of my favorite hotels. Thank you!!,Manuel at the front desk was the nicest front desk worker I have ever had the please of doing business with. He was knowledgeable about the area and answered all of our questions. He even helped me with the process of receiving an emergency package I had to have sent to the hotel. The valet parking was incredible, as me and my partner were in a huge rush to make a baseball game when we checked in. They went out of there way to park the car and then retrieve it for us so we could get our bags at a later time.,We really enjoyed our stay here. The front desk staff and housekeeping were professional, helpful and friendly. The location was great because it is close to a lot of restaurants and right next to the red line for the train. The Executive Lounge was nice and offered a great breakfast, snacks and beverages. We will definitely stay here if we visit Houston again in the future!,Very well located hotel within walking distance to Toyota center and Minute Maid park. Checking in was a breeze, valet parking was flawless. Everyone encountered was pleasant and helpful. Wish they had the evening reception on Fridays and Saturdays on the 11th floor lounge. Morning breakfast in the lounge was delicious with plenty of variety and nice comfortable seatings. The rooms are very quiet and well maintained. Only issue was the espresso machine was out of service and this really broke my heart. Not a deal breaker though. Will use again when in town.,What an amazing experience!  The hotel is so beautiful, the staff is so friendly, the valet are so cool, and the location is perfect. My wife and I were able to enjoy a nice quiet getaway from Austin for the Memorial Day holiday and the hotel really showed us amazing customer service.  The suite with the bathtub by the corner windows made my wife so happy and relaxed and we loved the executive lounge.  If you‚Äôre ever in Houston you should definitely give this place a stay."

My only minor complaint is that the scent in the lobby can be a little too aromatic for some people. I enjoy more woody smells, but if you like perfume aromas, you'll like the scents.,The hotel was great! All the staff were so kind, and I especially want to mention Larreta at the front desk who went out of her way to make her stay so amazing! We are in business, and we wish we could find people to work with us like her. She is truly a gem and The Four Seasons is lucky to have her.,Simply amazing!  Room was great!

The aesthetic of the place and the decor is so great! The painted murals on the wall, gothic architecture and stained glass windows really set the mood. The surrounding outdoor area is full of character- between the art cars, giant fountain and spacious patio, every seat is the best seat in the house.
I'm so happy there's a place like this in my hometown.
Bonus points: *Also their tables have purse/bag hooks for convenience*,I had an amazing time at this brewery! They offer a fantastic variety of beers, making it a great spot for beer enthusiasts. The ambiance is top-notch, with an antique design and a special car collection featuring icons like Jimi Hendrix and bands like Earth, Fire, and Water. Plus, the view of the Houston skyline is breathtaking. It's also a family-friendly place with plenty of games for kids, making it an excellent spot for everyone to hang out and enjoy.,This place has an enormous territory, but the beer variety is mediocre. They also don‚Äôt sell growlers. The place is also really expensive. It is very popularized, so high prices are expected. People working here are okay.,Very gracious hosts.  I've been fortunate enough to participate in a lot of events here for as long as they been at this location and the one before this one.  The team has always been incredible.  The event space is excellent.  Love the paintings on the wall.  The VIP area is comfortable and has a private bar available."

I ordered a large plate, but a small would suffice. The Thai tea is good, but I like it a bit sweeter and with less tapioca (I ordered it with tapioca). Overall, I love eating here!,To have seen this was rated one of the best Vietnamese spots in Houston.. I was highly disappointed in my experience.

I ordered two things, the egg rolls and a basic 11 (steak strip pho bowl), something I always get to test the waters at any pho spot and I wasn‚Äôt satisfied. I waited 15-20 minutes for my egg rolls to come out and they were lukewarm as if the staff was too busy LAUGHING and having SIDE conversations and forgot my food was sitting and waiting to be served. Though the flavor was good, it still wasn‚Äôt very pleasant for me as an experienced.

Twenty five minutes later and I‚Äôm still waiting on my pho bowl. Something that usually doesn‚Äôt takes that long is taking forever. I‚Äôve seen multiple people get serviced before me and it wasn‚Äôt even that busy. I started looking so irritated the waiter finally said something to me after bringing my all my fix-ins for a bowl that has yet to come to ensure me that it was still on the way.

The bowl finally comes but it was given to me by somebody from the back instead of a waiter and tbh he look like he was rushing to do it. Hear me out, just because my experience here was bad doesn‚Äôt mean I‚Äôm going to give the food an (non-honest) rating because to-be-honest that broth was probably some of the best I ever tasted. But, my bowl was lacking in meat (I even ordered the largest size bowl available) and my noodles were already mushy within the first 2 minutes.. the quality just wasn‚Äôt there for me.

What honestly pissed me off was the last 5 minutes of my experience.. seeing this man come in and was able to get his pho bowl in less than 5 minutes and his water refilled‚Ä¶. The waiter looked at me with the water pitcher in his hand.. looked at my almost empty water cup and went on his merry way‚Ä¶‚Ä¶

Smh. The broth is not that good enough to make me endure that type of mess again. I‚Äôm not even going to say it‚Äôs racism‚Ä¶ but tbh could‚Äôve been a great example‚Ä¶

(Ps: this review probably has some grammatical errors, that I will fix later but I‚Äôm so raw with emotion and passion behind this review I don‚Äôt care at the moment),I‚Äôve never seen pho with the beef like this.. EVER!
I didn‚Äôt even order the pho to begin with, I ordered their beef and rice but the way the beef was smoked made it taste awful & they offered to switch it out for a bowl of pho..
Got the bowl just to find the grossest beef I‚Äôve ever seen in a bowl of pho.
Also, please don‚Äôt think this was one little piece.. no no no, it was every single piece of beef in two bowls of pho‚Ä¶
I‚Äôve been eating pho since the early 2000‚Äôs & never have I ever seen beef with all that fat on it.
Sad thing is I used to frequent here in college and I made sure to find this spot again a decade later to relive some good ol days..,The parking is a tight. There‚Äôs a parking garage, there‚Äôs evidence of a homeless person sleeping in the stairwell.
Service was good. Surprisingly, once we place our order, did not wait long to get our food.  Plenty of bean sprouts, they were nice and fresh.,Best Pho in the whole USA!
Im serious!

After trying out many pho restaurants in the states, this is my favorite shop ‚ô•Ô∏è

Yes you can, open until 3am on weekends, this new york style pizza is just what you're wanting after a baseball game, concert, or a few drinks with friends. The classic cheese slice is the top winner, but the pepperoni and the Supreme are close 2nds. Have a beer or a soda and enjoy the downtown spot. We loved it.,The place is nice and very small. Gets packed very easily during the night! Good food for the price, we ordered an xl cheese pizza and fifteen wings, and they all tasted as expected. It was very delicious and good quality, as if it was from an NYC pizzeria. Definitely recommend giving this place a try if you want to have one of the best pizza Downtown Houston has to offer.,Delicious pizza the wings were cooked fresh. Long line but it moved super quick! Talked to some nice people in line.,Good pizza! Really amazing! Finding parking can be difficult, some homeless around so be careful.,Let me start out by saying Frank‚Äôs for nearly 8 years has been our favorite late night pizza spot until last week. Franks is a while in the wall pizza spot and I used to go for a slice or two and sometimes a whole pie but last well after not going for a while I noticed the pizza and quality has been compromised. The personnel was never why I went nor is the place super clean or nice but the pizza was the perfect amount of dough, sauce, cheese and ingredients. Last week I ordered my usual and it looked the same but once I bit into it I knew something had changed. I know places are getting skimpy with cheese like it‚Äôs going out of style but that‚Äôs such a crucial component to a pizza that it should not be allowed. I can appreciate the sauce not being super sweet and the thinly sliced dough but it needs cheese!!! Very disappointed."

Not burnt, nice and thick and creamy. Food wise, the chicken and waffles were great. Chicken was super juicy and waffles were crispy. The avocado toast is the reason for the one star dock. It was somewhat too simple?,It has been a couple of years since I've last enjoy this establishment's coffee. A lot has changed since then...for one they now serve food. I decides to stop by today and see how the menu was and catch up on some personal work. I was surprised by the new set up was allowed for way more seating then my last visit. There is plenty of work space, though power outlets are limited to those seated at a table near the wall. Not a problem for those who are powered up or will only spend a short amount of time there.

I decided to have the breakfast tacos (the vegetarian friendly option), which were very tasty. The coffee was pretty good too, depending on ones preference of acidity. I would give it a 4 and half star rating out of five.

Like I said there is plenty of work space/ seating which can be hard to find at some of Houston's top coffee shop. So if you are looking for good coffee and a place to get some work done...this is a great spot.,What a lovely place! I had a fried egg sandwich, it was excellent!!! Nice atmosphere and great service. Coffee was awesome,Thus far, Paper Co has provided me with the best coffee out of all the coffee shops in Houston that I've been to. After trying their cortado (the first I had ever had based on the barista's recommendation), I liked it so much that it sent me on a mission to try as many cortados at as many coffee shops as I could to see who had the best one. After going to over a dozen places, and continuing to go over a year later, I have yet to find a place with a better cortado. Paper Co's is rich, flavorful, creamy, and chocolatey. They never fail to serve it hot and to the brim, both features that are often lacking at many other places. While Paper Co does provide the best cortado, it isn't necessarily my favorite place to go overall. Some issues are the difficulty to get here, the significant lack of outlets preventing me from sticking around to do work, and the fact that not all of the drinks are necessarily good. Here is where I am a bit more biased because I don't like their Vietnamese coffee at all, but I've never been to a non-Vietnamese place where I enjoyed the Vietnamese coffee. I would still come here, of course, not only for the cortado but also because I like the large, open atmosphere (it's basically just a big warehouse). I would, and do, highly recommend Paper Co to any coffee lovers.,Great goal and missions. Coffee is roasted on the spot and there is a large placed. Good place to study and chill. Loft like feel.

At that moment I was ready to leave it just wasn‚Äôt a welcoming environment; I then reached for my drinks because I already felt extremely uncomfortable and just out of place, I just wanted to get the hell out of there. I then reached for my bag as well and the second employee snatches the bag.

I added banana and strawberries to the Nutella Crepe I had, but they put the fruits in the crepe with the Nutella. If you plan on doing the same, I'd recommend you telling them to put the fruits on the outside instead.

Lots of cars pass by and that just adds to the charm of the place I suppose. Overall, a great little place to grab breakfast of some afternoon snack.,It's a small amount of food for the price, but it wasn't aimed to be cost/hunger effective.

Was in for lunch today while waiting for my car to be worked on in Baytown. We‚Äôd seen this restaurant on YouTube, and our curiosity was peeked.

The atmosphere seemed like walking into Sanford & Son. While clean, there is clutter everywhere.

The owner came out and waited on us, the restaurant is actually much smaller in person than it looks on television. Without menus or prices, we only knew what we‚Äôd seen, which was just ask for something and they‚Äôll make it.

Well my wife asked for something, but they weren‚Äôt just out of it, it‚Äôs something they don‚Äôt even make at all. So she mentioned a dish and that‚Äôs what she got.

I ended up with 2 micro tamales (while fresh & tasty), a micro beef fajita with mexican rice. My wife got some kind of chicken dish, with guacamole. Very small portions.

For this I paid $98. Had I planned on $98? No. Was the food good? Yes. Will we be back? Only for the house watermelon lemonade.,A must for Mexican foodies! 5 across the board for authentic Mexican food that reminds me of visiting family. The entire staff welcome you and make sure to take care of you.

The food is worth the money and there‚Äôs no other place like this in Houston. As a Mexican, I am super picky about food and this Irma‚Äôs never disappoints. Plenty of places to get cheap Mexican food throughout Houston, but it doesn‚Äôt measure up to the food at Irma‚Äôs. You pay for what you get and if you don‚Äôt know the difference of great authentic food or appreciate Mexican cuisine go to chipotle!

All of the food is fresh and you can taste it in their dishes. The lentil soup starter prepares your taste buds for the goodness to come. Every dish I‚Äôve had at this place has been delicious. I never like Chile rellenos at restaurants, but Irma left me with no complaints. The Chile was light, fluffy, and stuffed with picadillo. The mole is always a hit too.

The decor of the restaurant gives me the sense of walking into my aunt‚Äôs or mom‚Äôs house with my cousins checking in on me while bringing me food. The owner walks around checking in on you - this very rarely happens in other restaurants.

I am writing this long review because I read that people complain about the prices, but undervalue Mexican food and the significance of this being a family owned business.

I always come to Irma‚Äôs for an experience like no other. Highly recommend to Mexican foodies!,Our first time today at Irma's. It was amazing. Ray made us feel right at home from the time we walked in the door until we left. Best service I have had in ages!  The food was some of the best I have had in Houston.

Realized it actually was not parking in the I almost got a ticket. So parking is on the street in front of the building and extremely limited.,Me and my friends visited this location before the Astros game. It was crowded, so we were seated upstairs.

The waiter was not great. No since of humor and barely came around. It took a long time for anything. The drinks, the appetizers and the food.

The drinks were great we annoyed them. The food was awful. Everyone had something different and did not like it. The devils eggs disgusting. None of us liked them. The final two were left on the table.

I had the chicken sandwich which was dry and more bread than chicken. The other chicken dish was also dry. Most of that was left on the plate. Half the blackened redfish tacos was left on the table.

Nothing was eaten in its entirety. I would go here for drinks, if I was at the bar. Otherwise, this is a no."

We were in Houston on a business trip and she found this place on open table and it had over 5000 5 star reviews. Well the food stood up to the reviews and was even better. The service was top notch as well! Next time we are in Houston this is must goto place for us!,Damian's is a restaurant that will forever hold a special place in my heart. It was the location of the very first upscale dining experience I shared with my wife back in the late 90s.

Recently, we decided to return to this cherished establishment, this time bringing our children along to share in the nostalgia and create new memories.

Upon revisiting, we were pleased to discover that some aspects of the restaurant had remained consistent over the years. The pasta sauce was every bit as flavorful as we remembered, and the fresh bread accompanied by their signature dipping oil remained a delicious staple.

However, there were a few key disappointments that detracted from our overall experience. Firstly, the service left something to be desired. We were forced to ask our waiter to check on our main course, as it had not arrived even 30 minutes after we had finished our appetizer.

Moreover, when our food finally arrived, we were disheartened by the lack of attention to presentation. The spaghetti appeared to have been haphazardly plated, with little consideration for visual appeal.

Our dissatisfaction extended to the preparation of the steak as well. While we had specifically requested a medium-rare cook, the steak arrived far too undercooked, bordering on raw. Consequently, we left nearly half of the steak uneaten, but the staff never inquired as to the reason for this.

In summary, while it was a pleasure to revisit Damian's and reminisce about our past experiences there, the evening was far from perfect. For a dinner that cost more than $65 per person, we expected a higher level of service and attention to detail. Considering there were four of us and we only ordered three dishes, the overall experience left us feeling somewhat let down.

I do need to mention that not everything on their website is on the menu, so I took pictures instead. I ordered the blue cheese bacon burger with waffle fries with an iced tea, the burger was TOO GOOD! And perfectly cooked, the cheese was so creamy, the bacon was nice and crispy and just melted in your mouth, the buns were perfectly roasted and even looked handmade. The only downside was that they gave me regular fries instead of waffle fries, so I mentioned it and they immediately fixed it, letting me have the regular AND the waffle fries for FREE, also the fries were perfectly seasoned with something similar to cajun blackened seasoning and they were also fried perfectly, so crunchy yet fluffy on the inside. The waitress was super kind and when you asked for anything extra like sauces, ice, lemons, she gave you A LOT, I absolutely loved it, like she drowned me in ranch that was also tasting homemade and very tasty. When she brought me lemon, she brought the same amount of lemon slices in a WHOLE LEMON just for my tea! Everyone was very charismatic and looked like they were having fun, but I will also say that the place was packed, so I'd probably reserve first just in case you're bringing more than two people with you. I would rate it 4.9/5.0 just because of the mess up, but again, the food was absolutely MIND BLOWINGLY AMAZING, you get so much for your money.

I suggest not paying extra for the seats up top, they all looked like they paid extra to watch a party down below at a far. If it's an opera or something like that then yes seats are nice.. But a rock or pop or mostly every other genre, the cheap standing tickets are the way to go!,What a mess, this venue really needs some training.  After paying top dollar for a ‚ÄúVIP‚Äù experience that was very much not the case.  Everyone knows it‚Äôs hot as all get out and you would expect a venue in Houston would know that.

Staff had no clue what was going on or how to control the crowd.  It was a very unsafe feeling after recent events.  After going through security which was very relaxed at that we moved to the next holding point.  After holding us hostage to the point of exhaustion they just opened the doors letting everyone in.  Paying no regard to the line of people and keeping order.  The staff literally said ‚Äújust figure it out‚Äù.  People who had been patiently waiting at the front were trampled over by people who had just showed up.  Once inside the disorganization continues with everything from the bar, the lines and the meet and greet.  This place is a joke. I seriously think they forgot they had a show and a job to do!,The place is big inside, nice venue, great space for a more intimate experience, nice bar area. The prices are ridiculous- cup of water $6. Otherwise I love this place.,Had a great time taking our nephews to a concert at the House of Blues. It‚Äôs a mid-sized venue with two tiers, a VIP section on the first floor and satellite bars on two walls. The bathrooms were nice and well maintained throughout the concert. Drinks were expensive, but that‚Äôs pretty much expected I think. Getting in and out was easy. Although we walked from a hotel and didn‚Äôt drive.

Let's dive into the details.

One aspect that stands out is the quality of the drinks. No matter how busy the store gets, the baristas consistently manage to make my drinks just right. The perfect blend of flavors, steamed milk at the ideal temperature, and those delightful swirls of whipped cream‚Äîthey never disappoint. For me, the taste and consistency of the beverages are paramount, and Starbucks nails it every time.

Now, I should mention that peak hours can be a bit challenging. As expected, lines tend to get longer, and the wait time can be a tad longer than usual. It's understandable considering the popularity of the place, but it's worth noting for those who may be pressed for time. Patience is definitely required during those busier periods.

Another minor concern I've noticed is the occasional side eye, rude and unprofessional service from one employee (the skinny hispanics male employee, I believe his name was Xye) which does makes me feel slightly uncomfortable. It's important to emphasize that this is not a consistent issue across the entire staff, but rather an isolated incident. While it can be off-putting, I don't let it overshadow the positive experiences I've had overall.

One aspect that I truly appreciate is that the baristas consistently write the note I want on my drink. Whether it's a personalized message or a specific customization, they make sure to fulfill my requests without fail. This attention to detail showcases their commitment to customer satisfaction and makes me feel valued as a patron.

In conclusion, despite the occasional wait during peak hours and the isolated incident of the side eye/rude service from a particular hispanic male employee (Xye), I find my visits to Starbucks enjoyable. The highlight remains the consistently well-crafted drinks, which are the essence of any coffeehouse experience. I'll definitely continue to frequent this Starbucks branch as the location is conveniently near my office.,This location has has been great all through Covid and even better after the manager Sarah came in. Their team is exceptional and if you are ever not satisfied with something, they are very quick to address that and make it right. Because of their openly friendly nature, they earned my business, and their kindness always makes this a pleasurable experience.

Give them all a raise! They go the extra mile for their customers.,It's good for the morning people that love to drink coffee. They got all kinds of selections to pick from that's if you like your coffee hot or you all can get it cold. They also have breakfast  plates and it's tour choice to get it with coffee or a orange juice. It's a very friendly environment to hang out with friends or just some good time with family members. Come check it out and you will know what am talking about.,Service was prompt but I hate these lids lol

Order was correct though,This Starbucks location is incorporated into the ground floor of a huge office building. And it is also just right across from Hyatt Regency Houston Hotel. Very conveniently located! The baristas are friendly and got my beverages right. They have everything (both food & beverages) that you find in a typical Starbucks store, including packaged coffee & drinkware. The seating area feels roomy being that it‚Äôs in an office building lobby. And they have both single arm chairs, long couches, and dining tables, along with a really long computer table to share with a group. They have good (free) WiFi speed. My only complaint is that there are very few electrical outlets to recharge one‚Äôs device. Other than that, it was a pleasant & enjoyable visit."

We returned to Sambuca after the show for dessert. We ordered the tiramisu and the chocolate lava cake. The tiramisu was light and airy, with a rich coffee flavor. The chocolate lava cake was warm and gooey, with a delicious chocolate center.
Overall, we had a wonderful dining experience at Sambuca. The food, atmosphere, and service were all excellent. We would highly recommend this restaurant to anyone looking for a delicious and memorable dining experience in Houston.,I went here for the first time for my birthday, I ordered the shrimp and crab dip. My food was good and everyone else in my party like their food as well, the band was great, the drinks were really good but the service was horrible. It took our waiter maybe 20+ minutes just to come to the table, 30+ minutes to take our order, 20+ minutes to bring our drinks and another 30+ to get the food. We only saw the waiter twice the entire time, the waiter working with the table across from ours assisted us way more (the tip should have went to him).,The food was great the service from the bartender was even better. Plus the music was awesome. Veal was incredibly tender, bordelaise could have used a pinch of salt. 10 out of 10 though, I'll be back there soon.,The food here was not good AT ALL!!!! I couldn‚Äôt wait to get home and brush my teeth to get the taste out of my mouth. Chicken was cheap. Mashed potatoes were buttery which doesn‚Äôt go with a Marsala dish. I paid for my food but will not be back.,For this being my first time here, I enjoyed it. The food was good and so was the mocktail. We went on a Saturday night for the live music. If you haven't been, I'll save you the surprise that we had, they add a $5 cover charge to your bill. I was not happy about that. It would have been nice to know that up front."

They've managed to figure out who I am and always say hi and even chat with me a few times when they're in between the rush. They always make the sandwiches quickly and of the Jimmy John's I've been to, these guys are by far the fastest. And they've always been friendly with me.,Just tried the new kickin' chicken and was not impressed. The commercial sold me to go try it, but the sandwich was complete disappointment. All I could taste was bread and sauce that's more mayo than spicy. Too many sauces on that particular sandwich and not sure if that's the way it's supposed to be. I liked the rotisserie chicken from subway and hoped this was an alternative since it went away. On a positive note, no issues with store because they were quick and friendly.,The waiter wiped the tomatoes and lettuce with the table cleaning rag after wiping entire table with it.  I complained but it was not addressed.,To begin I am 8 months pregnant and I have been ordering Jimmy Johns for years now, 6 to be exact. Today for lunch I decided to order something different from Jimmy Johns and have it delivered to my office. I normally order a Vito cut in half with extra mayo, extra hot peppers, and no onions with chips and a drink. Today I decided to order a tuna sandwich cut in half with mayo and mustard packets on the side, pickle spears, hot peppers, provolone cheese, and chips. Now the food came fast. The slogan ""food so freaky fast you will freak"" would be accurate in this situation if the food came correctly.

I ride the elevator up to our main floor and pick my food and take it back down to my desk. Dump out the contents of the bag and there are no mustard or mayo packets.  Im like okay whatever, Im already wobbling from the baby getting ready to make her exit soon and I don‚Äôt feel like walking down there so maybe the tuna won‚Äôt be so bad without the mayo. So I take a bite out of the sandwich hoping I wouldn‚Äôt need the mustard but that was a bad idea. It was definitely not what I had imagined and it was full of celery, which I knew came in the tuna but I didn‚Äôt expect the whole stalk to be on my sandwich.

So I decide to return the sandwich because I didn‚Äôt want it. Maybe if I had the mustard and mayo I would have just eaten it and said whatever. The cashier called the manager over and he was very rude. First he asked me was I returning the sandwich because there was no mustard or because I didn‚Äôt like it. After I told him both he sarcastically laughed in my face and asked what he was supposed to do. After telling him that I would just like a different sandwich he went on to say, in a snarky tone, that he can only reimburse me for the tuna sandwich. I asked ‚ÄúSo I can‚Äôt have another sandwich? You would rather give me my money back?‚Äù He then rudely asked what kind of sandwich I wanted. I told him the Vito and he yells down the line for the workers to begin preparing the sandwich without even asking me how I would like the sandwich. Then proceeded to tell me to write my name on the receipt like I am the one who gave him a hard time when all of this could have been avoided if I had some mustard packets included in my delivery!

I have never had an issue with Jimmy Johns but the experience I had today makes me not even want to ever take my business there again.,Consistently fast and friendly staff. Last time I got a tuna on which, it actually felt that they put it on bread by the size of the bag, but it was actually the amount of tuna that they put on the sandwich. It was almost enough for two days üòÅ.

Thanks for your suggestions and taking the time to explain pairings with us.,Food and service was great. Only issue is that it‚Äôs incredibly overpriced. $8 to add 1/2 an avocado to a salad. Also, they charge for substitutions, even if they are they same price. $2 substitution fee for green beans instead of asparagus. $2 fee for regular mashed potatoes instead of fried potato salad. This is on top of the $46 price for a filet.

The food was amazing and the ambience is stellar.  We will be back soon and often.  Loved the dress code and the staff's alertness. We had a fantastic time.

However, once everything was done, there was a huge pocket of air in my salad container. She didn't fill her scoops when making my salad, and when making my salad she was speaking spanish to her coworkers, making snarky comments about how, ""Look at this guy, he likes a lot of olive oil"".
Meanwhile, she stops looking at me completely, talks to her coworker, while pouring olive oil into the salad, and completely ignoring me while I'm telling her to stop pouring the olive oil. I'm never coming here again.

Got home and there was about a tablespoon of meat in 5 layer burrito and crunchwrap supreme. The bean burritos were about 1/3 smaller than usual and my encharitos had maybe a  ladel of sauce.They were out of mild sauce. I paid 28 dollars for what we got. The prices have gone up and the food amt down. Come on corporate.,paid 75 cents extra to sub chicken into my soft taco, and they put like a tablespoon of chicken on it. c'mon, are you kidding? this is just sad.,So, this is one of my bimonthly Taco Bell locations I frequent. I went in as normal to order from the counter. After waiting several minutes, I asked the lady behind the counter who was obviously ignoring me if I may order. She said I must order from the kiosk. I told her I don't want to order from the kiosk, I want to order at the counter. Mind you I'm the only guest in the restaurant, and I've had negative experiences in the past ordering from a kiosk. I asked her who told her customers must order from the kiosk and she said ""Mauricio"". She said again I need to order at the kiosk. I asked her if the cash register was out of order and she didn't like that and she said order from the kiosk, get out, or she is calling the police. Holly cow!! I told her to call the police and she dialed 911 on her cell phone. So I left the lobby and went through the drive through. Now the experience through the drive through was awesome. Completely different vibe. I just can't believe the lack of customer service inside. The manager who called 911 did say her boss, the franchisee (apparently Mauricio) was the one who told her to not serve guests at the counter, and to call the cops if customers were persistence on ordering at the counter.  If that's true, there are some issues. It shouldn't have escalated to this.

I did video record the majority of this interaction on my cell phone. I'm  contacting corporate in the morning. I will update.,Unfortunately, I have to give this Taco Bell negative review. I order three crispy tacos from the drive thru. When I got back to work to eat them I notice a weird strong smell coming from the taco. It was stale. It smelled and tasted so bad of stale! It was not fresh and the taco shells must of been kept for a long time and now are served to customer. It‚Äôs was so bad that I end up throwing my lunch food away. It‚Äôs awful to get food like this. Someone is not doing its job! No one should be served STALE FOOD!!!,The general manager of this store is so professional and offers the best customer service.

The service was good and they were accommodating with how we wanted our pizza prepared. They have larger size pizzas available as well, it‚Äôs pretty cool so check their menu out. Service was quick and pleasant. Sitting area in the restaurant is not too pleasant but overall very good.,Gotham Pizza is a great local pizza place in Houston that is perfect for a late-night slice. My father and I recently traveled into town and were looking for a place to get pizza after a long day of exploring. We decided to give Gotham Pizza a try and we were not disappointed.

We called ahead and ordered a large pepperoni pizza, and it was ready for pickup 15 minutes later. The pizza was cooked perfectly, with a crispy crust and a generous amount of pepperoni. The sauce was flavorful and the cheese was melted and gooey. We were both very impressed with the pizza, and it was definitely the perfect late-night meal.

The service at Gotham Pizza was also excellent. The staff was friendly and accommodating, and they made sure that our pizza was ready and waiting for us when we arrived. We would definitely recommend Gotham Pizza to anyone looking for a great local pizza place in Houston.,First time visiting. Service was great. The waiter was attentive. We had one order of mozzarella sticks with marinara for an appetizer. They were good but warm not hot. We also shared a large chef salad and a 16"" pizza. We were undecided about what type of pizza to get; the waiter told us they could do half & half; so, we did. It was New York style pizza ... large, wide slices, and thin crust.

This week I decided to go back and give it another try. I'm a vegetarian, and always request a veggie wrap. Since there's not going to be any meat in the wrap, I expect that they'll fill that space with additional vegetables (so I don't end up with an empty wrap). For the past two days, they've literally given me 5 kale leaves and 5 spinach leaves, and when I asked for more she added 2 more leaves (TWO!). I then asked for more (again) and she had to go ask the manager for permission?! I don't quite understand why they're so stingy especially since the salads/wraps are not cheap. If I'm going to spend $8 on a wrap filled with vegetables, I expect it to be filled well.

I asked for a small spinach salad and since I cant have any of the beans and fruits I normally ask for more spinach the lady gave me 2 extra leafs. Then I asked for more and again have me 2 leafs. Asked the manager for more and looked at me weird not only have I had already this conversation before with this particular manager of me only getting spinach, chicken and cheese and yet they told me I should get a large salad instead if I wanted more spinach. WHY is this Ok? Salata this horrible service made you lose a daily customer today! Will never buy salata at this location again.

This doesnt even cover my coworkers grapes that they give her almost 2 grapes when she asks for it. And by 2 I mean 2 halfs of a single grape. Thats her story not mine!,Be careful on what they charged you. They charged me $10 for small chicken salad, I asked and the lady said price has been increased. i odered online the nxt day, only $9!

Very nice staff.,We stayed at Hotel Icon after our civil wedding at the historic courthouse downtown, and it was fantastic! The hotel vibe is really cool, and the rooms were unique, clean, & nice. The staff was awesome - Mallory (i think) at the front desk helped us with early check-in & handled many requests from our wedding guests. The bar service was also great; we shared a champagne toast in the lobby after the ceremony. Every staff member we interacted with was helpful. The rooms were great as well - the bathroom was very spacious, and there was plenty of room in the King room.,My recent five-night stay at the Icon Hotel (Autograph Collection) in Houston, Texas was an absolute delight. From the beautiful room with a great city view to the exceptional breakfasts and inviting bar, every moment was a testament to the hotel's commitment to excellence.

The breakfasts were a great array of options that catered to all tastes and my gluten-free needs. From healthy choices to classics, each morning was a delightful culinary adventure. The bar was impressive, offering a sophisticated setting that quickly became a favorite spot to unwind. We were also extremely grateful to the staff's (and particularly Chef Ivan‚Äôs) dedication to ensuring our stay was perfect. The warmth and professionalism we experienced, combined with so many nice details in this historic hotel, created the perfect relaxing environment where we could deal with the serious purpose of our visit to Houston.

If you're seeking a refined and welcoming stay in Houston, the Icon Hotel is an exceptional choice that I wholeheartedly recommend.,This hotel was absolutely beautiful an well decorated. Our room had such an amazing view both in the day and at night. The seeing the sun rise and set was one of the highlights of the room. I give the location a 4 star because although the area was nice when it came to the view, the party life downtown really takes away from the relaxation at night. With clubs being right across the street all you can hear is the loud music which was fun the first night but not so much the nights following.,Stayed at this charming hotel in downtown Houston. The location is great but we were disappointed the hotel doesn‚Äôt include parking (you have to pay an extra $45 for valet parking or find your own and walk a few blocks). The breakfast is also not included, it‚Äôs $25 extra. The rooms were nice and the decoration was beautiful. But the bathroom pipes were incredibly loud, every time a neighbor flushed the toilet or took a shower there would be a loud screeching noise. Also the water in the shower would not go down fast enough. I expected more from a 4 star hotel."

I enjoy staying in boutique hotels like this, especially buildings with character like this one. This hotel has valet parking only at the sum of about $39 a night which is not too terrible for downtown Houston. The parking garage is located very close by if you need to go to your car to grab something. I enjoyed the convenience of Marriott's mobile check-in and the ability to have a digital hotel key which prevented me from having to get new keys and I left my keys up in the room. The staff were very kind and friendly and we're very responsive using the chat feature on the app. They allowed me to check in early and check out late since The conference I was in town for ran a little late. The hotel itself was very nicely appointed and I found the rooms to be very comfortable and luxurious. I like to sleep in almost complete darkness and I found that the blackout curtains in the room did their jobs very nicely despite all of the lights of the city. I really enjoyed the large soaking tub that I used all three nights I was there. The milk and cookies in the lobby starting at 8:00 p.m. is an extra nice touch and that too I utilized all three nights I was there. The rooftop pool was small and is only about 3 ft deep. The hot tub is a nice addition, but That's more of a warm tub and the jets were a bit weak which was my only complaint about my entire stay. I enjoyed the location and it's proximity to lots of different things downtown including the nearby convention center (about a 10 minute walk) as well as lots of different restaurants and a CVS pharmacy if you run out of supplies. The Hotel itself is in a pretty decent part of town and I felt very safe walking around in the night time hour. I would definitely return and stay at this charming hotel again.,We had an amazing time at the Magnolia. Everything is beautifully appointed, the staff were friendly and attentive, the room was great and the bed was comfortable. The roof offers gorgeous views - I recommend taking a beverage up there to hang out for a bit. I loved my interactions with Northon Holiday who made me feel welcomed and important as well as being incredibly knowledgeable and helpful. I look forward to staying again and sending others as well!,This place is a joke.  I have Marriott Titanium status and whoever rated this one of the best hotels in 2022 was paid off.  Basic Marriott hotels are in better shape than this and the room service is terrible.  Again, 80+ Marriott nights this year and this was worst hotel by far.,These reviews did not match my experience at all and I could not have been more disappointed. I'm an elite bonvoy member, travel often, and rarely have a poor hotel experience. Considering this hotel had nice reviews and great ratings within the bonvoy system, I figured this would easily be a great experience.  It was anything but a good experience.
The check-in staff just did not want to be at work. They were unnecessarily rude to a point I even looked around to make sure I wasn't being filmed for a prank show or something.
There was never milk and cookies.  The pool was closed. The beds and pillows were, like the check-in process, unbelievably uncomfortable. Not uncomfortable like too plush or too firm, uncomfortable like lumpy and old. The hotel building is from 1926, apparently the bed was too.
I did not eat there. The restaurant looked nice enough though.
Yes, the location is good if you have to stay downtown but there are many great neighborhoods in Houston to choose from.
I've stayed at lower rated hotels in downtown Houston that should have been rated 4 stars, then I stay here and it should be a 2 star rated hotel.
Travelers beware. I do not recommend this hotel if you have to stay in Downton Houston.

Also after writing this review I found pending duplicate charges from the hotel. Hopefully the charges won't clear my credit card, but the staff mistakenly charged me hundreds.,Valet parking upon check out very very slow.approx 40 min  to get my car that was parked behind the hotel and attendance given plenty of time to retrieve my vehicle. Rooms nice but bathroom.door should open out and not in due to limited room with door open. Beds were right next to door. Nice location for Astros game and Catholic church down the street. Restaurant's close by also."
